<p>The choice of a trustworthy local partner is a big challenge facing international travel companies. In our increasingly  globalized world, more and more information is sourced directly from Internet, and it can be difficult to ascertain its reliability.  How to choose the right local experts? How to know if they will be up to our expectations? Without any doubt, the responsibility of a successful travel organization lies on their local knowledge and logistical skills.<br></p>

<h3><strong>A few  useful tips</strong></h3>

<p>As always, we should start with a deep and accurate research. Informative material should be gathered through different channels: Internet, specialized press, advertisement, Governmental agencies, and, last but not the least, the traditional word of mouth. Through the collection and comparison of all this information it is possible to come to some preliminary ranking. After all, there is only one &quot;first impression&quot;, and it can have a very strong impact on your selection process. Once made this first and intuitive creaming off, it is important to move a bit further and take the second step:  verification and direct contact. There are many possibilities of finding out the working methods of the local companies. The most direct and rewarding might be simply to call them: having a chat with a member of the company could be very helpful to determine the knowledge and competence level of the agency. In this way you could even test if there is a “feeling” and if you actually share the same working ideas. A second potential approach  is more indirect and subtle: contact the local company via e-mail for an informal enquiry. From their reply, you could get a reliable impression of their communication and organizational skills. Last but not least, always check if the local agency is legally recognized before you, or, even worst, your customers, find yourselves stuck in tricky and potentially unpleasant situations. Once you feel confident with all these composite facets, don’t hesitate further and start a lasting partnership. Local experts are essential for offering to your customers a diversified array of attractive  travel packages, and are the key for a highly satisfactory outcome.
