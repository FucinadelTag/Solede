<p>In every guidebook of Venice you will surely find a reference to the magnificent, stunning and impressive Doge’s Palace. Now, your question might be “is it really that impressive to be worth my ticket and precious time in Venice?” Obviously, the answer is “yes, do yourself a favor and take all the time you need to visit the Doge’s Palace.” Venice has long been one of the most prosperous cities in all of Europe and also the biggest trading center that connected Europe with the Eastern world, so the Palace, once home to the Doge of the city, has all the rights in the world to be the highest and richest symbol of Venetian civilization. In fact, from the end of the Roman Empire to the Napoleonic Wars, the Doge, like the Duke of the city, was the chief magistrate and leader of the Republic of Venice. In other words, when a situation turned ugly, the Doge was the &quot;go-to&quot; guy for help and explanations. But not all doges were honest and the great Council of Ten constantly had to strive against conspiracy to bring the city back to normal.</p>

<p>The Palace itself is really an artwork, with several breathtaking rooms: you can visit the Doge’s apartments and countless institutional chambers, pass secret access doors disguised as wardrobes, take a look at the torture chambers used by the secret police to extract information, and cross tunnels that took captives straight into prison after a court hearing. Said times were tough on the captives: once found guilty, there was no time to say goodbye to Venice, aside from a last glimpse of the outside while walking across the Bridge of Sighs, where prisoners would &quot;sigh&quot; as they crossed the bridge and saw Venice for the last time. Venetian prisons were known for being extremely inhospitable, with cells connected by bleak, murky corridors; during the legendary floods of the city, the cells of the old prisons were often underwater up to the beds. The most famous runaway from these prisons was also the most famous lover in history – Giacomo Casanova, who ended up in prison for his “public outrages against the holy religion”, as the Tribunal said. Well, in his magnificent escape from prison, Casanova climbed out of his cell onto the roof and then went down into an attic. A man full of surprises, worthy of his reputation!</p>

<p>Not only is the Palace one of the city’s most interesting buildings from a historic point of view, it’s also home to the most beautiful artworks in all of Venice. You may not be an art critic specialized in Italian Renaissance art, but the paintings that you will find here boast the signature of the greatest Venetian masters of all time, including Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese. <br>Enchanting, fascinating, and gorgeous from several points of view, Venice will surprise you, no matter how much you have travelled around before ending up here.<br></p>
