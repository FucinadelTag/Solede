<p>When travelling to Venice, one of the things all tourists absolutely want to do is ride a gondola. Surely, it’s <strong>charming, unique</strong>, and one of those things you have to do to avoid those “I can&#39;t believe you didn&#39;t see…” moments. A ride on a gondola, though very iconic, can also be rather expensive. The official rates are €80 for a 40-minute ride – after 7pm, the price rises to €100 – but be assured that no gondolier will actually stick, even remotely, to those official rates. If you are travelling with friends, you can have six people in total on a gondola, so you can split the cost of the ride, and this will make it more affordable!<br>It can’t be denied that, of course, gondola rides are clearly for tourists. You won’t see any Venetians on gondolas – except the gondolier, of course! Touristy or not, your visit to Venice wouldn’t seem complete until you took one of these. Moreover, we have to admit that <strong>the best way to catch sight of the 500-year-old palazzi and churches is from the canals</strong>. Gondolas are unique in history. Back in the 11th century, gondolas were the main means of transportation and the most common watercraft in Venice. They were owned by upper-class Venetians, who spent a fair amount of attention to dressing up their gondolas to make them look as elegant as possible.</p>

<p>Just to tell you some of their features, the bottom of the gondola is flat to navigate the shallow waters of the Venetian lagoon, which is only a few cm deep; the iron of the gondola head is essential to gain stability by counterbalancing the gondolier&#39;s weight. It is also <strong>amazing to observe the gondoliers going about their jobs</strong>. Small intersections can pose a risk of collision for 2 gondolas.  To get around the problem, when approaching a blind intersection, the gondolier will simply let out a loud whistle. A gondolier, when approaching from another direction but still out of sight, would answer with another whistle. One gondola could then yield the right of way to the other without fear of a collision.</p>
