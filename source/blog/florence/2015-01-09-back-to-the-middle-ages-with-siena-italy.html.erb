<p>Travellers to Tuscany may come for several reasons. Many may come to see great artworks for themselves, and others to explore the rolling countryside and find some peace of mind. You may come to Tuscany to enjoy the wonderful cuisine and wine. Students come to learn the beautiful Italian language and culture. <strong>Little gems of towns may appear in front of you, unexpectedly</strong>. Today we are not talking about the top city of art in Tuscany, Florence, but instead we’d like to put under the spotlight another treasure that Tuscany has in store for us, Siena.</p>

<p>Siena is a small hill town surrounded by the countryside that transports you back to the Middle Ages, with gorgeous frescoes, main piazzas and spectacular views. Russet buildings are all around you, and there&#39;s a tall bell-tower in the middle of the town. Siena is big enough that you want to wander for more than a couple of hours but not so big that you feel overwhelmed. <strong>The centre of the city is dominated by the large, 13th-century main square, Piazza del Campo</strong>, which is unlike any other piazza around Italy, starting from its shape. In fact, climbing on the top of the Tower del Mangia (you can hike up the stairs, exactly 400 steps) you would instantly notice the shell-shaped piazza, divided into 9 slices. You most likely wouldn’t need a written invitation to sit in one of the local cafés facing the piazza and taste delicacies you won’t find anywhere else but in Siena, like cavallucci, ricciarelli and panforte - 3 kinds of biscuits whose origins are lost in time. The piazza is also home to the Palio, perhaps the most notorious horse race in the world, held twice a year. No wonder Piazza del Campo is <strong>a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</strong></p>

<p>The first thing you may notice from a picture of Siena would probably be the imposing Tower del Mangia, a beautiful combination of height and elegance. It’s just 7 meters taller than the tower of Palazzo Vecchio in Florence… and you can bet that was done on purpose! And that is understandable if we think that <strong>from the 13th to 15th centuries Siena was Florence’s main rival</strong> as the 2 cities were both trying to enlarge their territory. Overstepping centuries of rivalry, Florence and Siena upheld their elegant style: their skylines with medieval towers, reddish-brown rooftops, towering domes and Renaissance galleries are indeed picturesque and uncommonly enchanting.</p>
