<p>We were asked to <a href="http://www.solede.com/blog/group-tours-to-italy/2015-09-28-educational-travel-how-solede-planned-a-complete-trip-to-italy.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=articolo%20blog&utm_campaign=Educational%20travel%3A%20how%20Solede%20managed%20to%20create%20an%20amazing%20trip%20to%20Italy">plan an educational trip to Northern Italy for a group of 40 American students</a> who wanted to know more of Italian economy and companies, since they were studying the field of economy.<br>After understanding all the requests of the foundation that contacted us, we planned an itinerary and the foundation was completely happy with our job, but unfortunately not everyone felt the same way.</p>

<p></p>

<h3><strong>HOW TO HANDLE CRITICS</strong></h3>

<p>One of the two professors who would have accompanied the class to Italy for 10 days had several critics to the itinerary we planned.<br>He didn’t agree in spending half the time in Milan and half in Modena as we proposed, since he would have prefered to sleep in Florence, Sirmione, Verona and Venice too. Sleeping in 6 cities in only 8 days sounded as a complete nonsense to us, since we had one small thing to take into account: time. Moreover, we were not planning a trip for a young couple travelling to Italy, but for a class of 40 students: transfers are inevitably slow, attractions you can see are limited by the group size and hotel managers don’t agree in making discounts for only one night at their hotel.<br>When we received these requests we knew that not all them could and had to be listened, or we would have been overwhelmed by thousands of other requirements, most of them unfeasible. On the other hand, we couldn’t simply get rid of those complaints, so we did our best to fulfil some of the requirements with the budget and time we had at disposal. <br>We managed to plan an even greater itinerary that took into consideration not only the professor’s needs, but also time for transfers and students tiredness.</p>

<h3><strong>OPTIMISE TIME AT DISPOSAL</strong></h3>

<p>Following the new requirements, we decided to change the planned itinerary and make 3 main stops: Milan, Sirmione and Venice.<br>It was pretty clear to us that students wanted to see everything possible during their stay in northern Italy. In order to accomplish this task, we decided to optimise time, especially during transportation from one city to the other. <br>During their stay in Milan, students would have paid a visit to Modena, in order to visit the Ferrari Museum and also a balsamic vinegar company, which offers a vinegar degustation. Como was only an-hour away from Milan, and students would have spent the day relaxing and having fun on the lake shore. <br>During the bus transfer from Milan to Sirmione, students would have stopped to Pastrengo in the morning to visit the provider of paper-based packaging solutions, Smurfit Kappa. <br>Once in Sirmione they would have been able to take a day visit to Verona, only an hour away by bus, and spend the entire day in the city with a local guide to admire the famous Juliet’s balcony, the Arena and much more.<br>After their stay in Sirmione, they would have taken their bus to reach Venice: since hotels in Venice city centre were rather over budget, we opted for a hotel in the close village of Mestre, which turned out to be a good choice. In 2 days students would have had time to see the countless bridges of Venice, Piazza San Marco, Doge’s palace and even a glass blowing factory. We also planned a visit to the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in central Venice to admire the modern art museum on the Grand Canal.</p>

<h3><strong>THE FINAL APPROVAL</strong></h3>

<p>Once the revised itinerary was completed, it was submitted again to the foundation and to the professors. We were glad to know that they both agreed on the itinerary and appreciated our effort to include most of their suggestions. We obtained the final approval and started to organise the trip to Italy in every detail.</p>
