<p>During the month of February we were contacted by an Educational Foundation in the US. They offered faculty-led travel programs and wanted to plan a trip in Northern Italy for a class of students in the month of July. They asked for help from Solede in order to plan the itinerary in every detail and carry out the tour once in Italy.</p>

<h3><strong>LISTEN TO PEOPLE’S NEEDS</strong></h3>

<p>We tried to better understand their needs and requests, and gather all the information we could. Since the class was studying the field of economics and the professors travelling with them taught International management and Marketing, they were interested in visiting some economic companies in the country. This lead us to choose Milan as the main city during the sejour, thanks to the large number of companies and financial-related societies in that area of Italy.<br>Due to the numerous group (40 students) we decided to limit hotel changes and opted to sleep in Milan for 4 nights, in Modena for 3 nights (students wanted to visit Ferrari Museum), and then Milan for the last night.<br>We started working on the project and found some companies willing to host 40 students and show them their headquarters or company museums: a world-famous design company (Kartell) and a leading pharmaceutical company (Zambon). We managed to plan a visit to the historical archives of Intesa San Paolo bank (one of the leading banks of Italy), and also a visit to the most important University of Economy in Milan, Bocconi University, where professors would have been happy to make a presentation of their courses and give an overview of the university. <strong>We always do our best to fulfil our clients&#39; needs and meet their expectations.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>PLAN FUNNY ACTIVITIES</strong></h3>

<p>Once the foundation agreed on the main stops, we started to enrich the tour to make it more pleasant for students.<br>We included a day-trip to Como Lake (only one hour from Milan) with a boat tour and a trekking in the mountains around the lake, then a visit to Expo (the universal exhibition hosted in Milan from May to October 2015). From the city of Modena we planned a day-trip to Verona (2 hours away) to visit the famous Roman amphitheater and Romeo and Juliet’s balcony. Venice was not far either, so we could manage a day-trip there too: once there students could also visit a glass blowing factory in San Marco square, countless bridges and fascinating views.<br><strong>We did everything to find the right balance between educational and leisure activities, but also between free time and time spent with the rest of the class. </strong></p>

<p></p>

<h3><strong>WAIT FOR APPROVAL</strong></h3>

<p>Once the itinerary was completed, we submitted it to the educational foundation in order to proceed to the next step. They were really excited about our job, especially for the wise combination of education, culture and fun! Of course, it is an educational travel but we can not forget the importance of fun and free time, since after all it’s students’ trip to Italy!<br>We still needed to obtain the approval from the 2 professors, who has the right to make some changes. The response we received was completely unexpected. One of the professors said he wanted to stay only 2 nights in Milan, then 1 night in Florence, 1 in Sirmione to visit the Roman ruins, 2 nights in Verona, and 2 other nights in Venice. He also wanted to reach Pastrengo, near Verona, to visit a provider of paper-based packaging solutions, Smurfit Kappa. The first immediate problem that occurred was that Florence was 300 km away from the other cities, quite far from the itinerary established. Sleeping in Verona was problematic too, due to Verona Opera festival hold in July and the unlikelihood to find a hotel willing to host 40 students in that particular moment of the year. Moreover, sleeping in Venice would have been over the budget we were given.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At that point, what could we do to make the professor happy with the itinerary without going over budget and without tiring students too much with continuous hotel changes? Coming soon...</p>
