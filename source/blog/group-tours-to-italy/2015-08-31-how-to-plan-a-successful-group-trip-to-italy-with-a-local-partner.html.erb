<p>Italy is one of the most popular destinations in Europe: whether you are planning a culinary tour, a cultural and historical trip or a holiday based on hiking and nature, Italy will offer countless must-see locations. But planning a group tour to Italy can sometimes be a hard task. This is why it is usually better to count on local experts who deeply know their country. Once you have chosen a trustworthy local partner, try to be as clear as possible about what your customers expect from their trip to Italy, or they will be disappointed in the outcome. Talk clearly and explain who your customers are and what they are looking for. Following these tips you’ll be able to dialog effectively with your local partner and create the precise tour you want.</p>

<h3><strong>Be focused on the purpose of the trip</strong></h3>

<p>Italy is a gold mine. There are thousands of different trips you can plan, but not all of them are suitable for your group: try to understand what is the purpose of the trip in order to let your partner tailor an itinerary that fits your customers’ requests.<br>Is the group attending courses to become pastry chefs and would like to taste Italian delicacies? Are they students attending an economy class together and travelling with their International Management teacher?<br>Once you have clarified the travel purpose, try to understand its importance during the entire holiday. Does the group want to devote the entire trip to the analysis of a specific theme or would they rather save some time to enjoy the Bella Italia on their own?</p>

<p></p>

<h3><strong>Be informed on your group’s needs</strong></h3>

<p>Your group is not a nameless identity and each person that forms it has several needs that has to be listened. But be careful and never let yourself be overwhelmed by thousands of requests. Many of them are important and need to be taken into account (persons with reduced mobilities, food allergies), some are not of prime importance, and others are not to be supported at all. Try to prioritize! Once you have cleared up you mind about your customers’ requests, you can inform your local partner.</p>

<h3><strong>Think about the main stops of the trip</strong></h3>

<p>Be informed on the possible attractions the group might visit in Italy. Even if you completely trust your Italian partner, your suggestions will be useful for him/her to understand what kind of itinerary you are looking for.<br>If you are planning an educational trip for an archeology and ancient history class, you might be pretty sure you can not forget Rome (of course, how not to visit the Colosseum or the Roman Forum?), and you might have heard of Pompeii, the ancient Roman town-city in the Amalfi coast that was destroyed and buried under 4 to 6 m. Your tips would be a precious help for your partner to understand what you’d like to plan.</p>

<p></p>

<h3><strong>Listen to suggestions</strong></h3>

<p>Even if you have travelled to Italy twice a year in the last decades and think to know Italy like the back of your hand, you have decided to contact local experts because you needed their help to plan the itinerary to Italy. So be willing to listen to new suggestions, or you will be considered the wiseacre who knows everything. <br>An expert may convey that yes, Rome is a must do stop for your archeological and ancient-history itinerary, but the less famous Herculaneum (the ancient Roman town destroyed by the same volcanic flows of Pompeii in 79 AD) is a better choice than the very touristic, poorly preserved and enormous Pompeii. Your Italian partner is here to help, so trust his/her suggestions.</p>
