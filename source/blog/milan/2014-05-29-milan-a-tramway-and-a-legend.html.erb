<p class="abstract">Even if you have just arrived in Milan, you certainly must have noticed them: orange, big tramways right in the center of the city. Sometimes they are late, overcrowded, but their charm is incomparable to the carriages of a subway. </p>

<p>El Gamba de Legn’: ‘<strong>the Wooden Leg</strong>’ is a rather uncommon name for a means of transport. This was the nickname that citizens of Milan gave to the first steam-powered tram in <strong>1878</strong>. Why wooden leg? Some people tell that since Milan was famous in Italy for its fog, a pedestrian equipped with a whistle preceded the tram in order to warn people about its arrival, but he unfortunately had an accident and needed a wooden leg to walk. Other people tell that  the tram, running slowly along the tracks, made a monotonous “To-Toc To-Toc” sound, like a person walking with a wooden leg.</p>

<p>But let’s start from the beginning: at the end of the XIX century Milan was in full expansion, the farmers of the countryside became the workers of the big city and these new commuters needed a fast way to go to work and to go back home at the end of the day.</p>

<p>When the first steam trams arrived in Milan, they crossed the center of the city from Piazza Duomo to Corso Sempione through new residential areas. At that time it was a masterpiece of technology - especially if we consider that trams used to be drawn by horses and could carry a dozen people.</p>

<p>So, when you get on an <strong>orange coloured tram</strong>, just stick your head out of the window, hear its sound, remember this legend and the story of the wooden leg.</p>
