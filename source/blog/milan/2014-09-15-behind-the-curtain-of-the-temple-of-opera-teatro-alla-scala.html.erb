<p>Itâ€™s since the beginning of the XVIII century that Milan has its city theatre, Teatro Regio Ducal, where noble Milanese people used to meet. At that time, theatres were noisy, chaotic places where the major aim was to see and be seen. To imagine how  theatre was back in the past, we should stop thinking about it as a place where to enjoy great composers: audiences would chat, walk around and play games during the performance, exactly as we would do in<strong> </strong>a play room! When Teatro Regio Ducal burned down in 1776, a new theatre was commissioned to be built by the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, and in less than two years Teatro La Scala saw the light. Milanese people had their brand new theatre where to <strong>enjoy opera music, dance during the major events and..play cards!</strong>
Above the lavishly decorated boxes stands the Loggione, where the most critical opera aficionados typically stayed. You should know that La Scala was, and still is, notorious for its <strong>bad-tempered public</strong> that booed and hissed, threw garbage at singers they didn't like and created untold misery for singers and administrators. Just remind that decades ago the great Maria Callas was booed for her performance by a public that threw radishes at her. She picked up the radishes, turned to her fellow-singers and bowed to them, in a show of humility.
Unfortunately the bombs of the Second World War damaged the theatre very badly, and after quick works of renovation it opened again, but many people complained about its worsened acoustic. To fix the problem, the theatre underwent a major renovation on 2002. The acoustic was gradually improved and after 3 years of renovation La Scala raised again its curtain, more beautiful than ever.</p>
