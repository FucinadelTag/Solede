<p>Since the beginning of the XVIII century, Milan has had as its city theatre, Teatro Regio Ducal; a place where noble Milanese people used to meet. At the time, theatres were noisy, chaotic places where the major aim was to see and be seen. To imagine how the theatre was back then, we need to stop thinking of theatres as places to enjoy great composers: audiences would chat, walk around, and play games during the performance, exactly as we would do in a play room! When Teatro Regio Ducal burned down in 1776, a new theatre was commissioned to be built by the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, and in less than two years, Teatro La Scala, saw the light. Milanese people had a brand new theatre to <strong>enjoy opera music, dance during major events, and... play cards!</strong><br>Above the boxes, lavishly decorated by their owners, stands the Loggione, where the most critical opera aficionados typically stayed. You should know that La Scala was, and still is, notorious for its <strong>bad-tempered public</strong> that booed and hissed, threw garbage at singers they didn&#39;t like, and created untold misery for singers and administrators. Just remember that decades ago the great Maria Callas was booed for her performance by a public that threw radishes at her. She picked up the radishes, turned to her fellow-singers and bowed to them in a show of humility.<br>Unfortunately, the bombs of the Second World War damaged the theatre very badly, and after quick renovation efforts, the theatre opened again, but many people complained about its worsened acoustics. To fix this problem, the theatre underwent a major renovation in 2002. The acoustics were improved and after 3 years of renovations La Scala again raised its curtain, more beautiful than ever.</p>
