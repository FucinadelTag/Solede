<p>After winning the <strong>International Highrise Award</strong>, Stefano Boeri with his Bosco Verticale is the pride of Milan and of all Italy. From over 800 highrises that were commissioned worldwide over the last two years, Deutsches Architekturmuseum (DAM) chose 26 impressing constructions from 17 countries. The award aims to celebrate excellence in recent buildings that stand a minimum of 100 meters tall. The jury resolved unanimously and “Bosco Verticale” won the illustrious reward. “<strong>Bosco Verticale is a marvelous project! It’s an expression of the extensive human need for green”,</strong> pronounced the jury of experts chaired by Christoph Ingenhoven, the last IHA prize winner. “The ‘wooded highrises’ are a striking example of a symbiosis of architecture and nature”. A great reward for the project designed by Stefano Boeri Architetti and developed by Hines Italia. <br></p>

<p>Completed in June 2014, the project of Bosco Verticale includes two lushly-planted residential highrises. Each of the 113 apartments is provided with a balcony, which looks like a private forest or small garden: <strong>800 trees up to 9 meters tall, 5.000 bushes and 11.000 small plants cover the facade</strong>. The plants provide a natural climate in the whole building and outstanding residential conditions. Milan is known to be the city with the highest pollution levels in whole Italy: due to this, the main purpose of the project was to give the city a different look, and they succeeded! Furthermore, the buildings come with a water recycling system as well as a photovoltaic solar cells. <strong>An eco friendly way to see architecture</strong>.<br></p>

<p>Expert architects, structural engineers and real estate specialists composing the international jury of the IHA declared Bosco Verticale to be “<strong>a prototype for the cities of tomorrow</strong>”. An example of sustainability and interior qualities. “I am very glad for this prestigious award,” said project architect, Stefano Boeri. “I am glad because the prize to the Bosco Verticale is a recognition to experimentation in architecture; it is an invitation to think about architecture as an anticipation of the future for everyone – and not just as the emergence of a style or language.”</p>
