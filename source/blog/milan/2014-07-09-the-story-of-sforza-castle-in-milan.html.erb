<p>As you arrive in Milan you will never expect such a <strong>great and magnificent castle</strong> in the center of the city. Indeed, this castle has such a rough story that you will never understand simply by crossing the drawbridge, staring at the Torre del Filarete or walking along its wide and quiet park.</p>

<p>Conceived as a fortress by the first duke of Milan, Galeazzo Visconti II, the castle soon became a <strong>palatial residence</strong>, with inner courtyards that aimed at creating a cozy and warm living space. Unfortunately, as soon as the Ambrosian republic was proclaimed in the XV century, the castle was <strong>razed to the ground</strong> by Milanese people, who considered the castle just a mere emblem of power. The new military leader, Francesco Sforza didn’t waste time and ordered to rebuilt the castle, this time with <strong>Torre del Filarete</strong>. This difficult story didn’t spare the castle from becoming a barracks during the foreign assaults of the city. After the Italian unification in 1861 the castle was in such a bad shape that the city considered demolishing it. <strong>Architect Luca Beltrami</strong> however saved the castle from the wrecking ball by suggesting to convert it into a public building.</p>

<p>Every castle has its story to tell, and certainly Sforza castle, with its heirs and battles has one.<br></p>
