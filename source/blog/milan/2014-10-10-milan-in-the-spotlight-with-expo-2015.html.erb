<p>Expo 2015 is getting closer and now it is just around the corner. Milan will host together 144 nations, international organizations and corporations to promote their activities and proposals for the future, themed around food and nutrition. This is precisely the central theme of EXPO 2015, <strong>Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life</strong>. It would be analysed through different thematic routes, that will offer several interpretations of the issue. Food really seems to be the most fitting theme for Italy. When most foreigners think about Italy they would say, usually with their hands moving around, “Italia! pizza, pasta and mandolino”. Well, from a superficial perspective Expo 2015 really seems to stress this stereotype: an international exposition focused on food and culinary culture.</p>

<p>Actually, the theme is not so taken for granted as it may sounds, but it focuses instead on the <strong>link between food and sustainability, innovation, technology and creativity</strong>. Certainly Italy has always had a special relationship with food, but during Expo every country will be taken into account, from its history of food to farming techniques. There will be space to deepen some contemporary paradoxes, from malnutrition to food waste; food sustainability will be a key point to create a more equitable world. </p>

<p><strong>Food and nutrition affects every issue of our life</strong>. Whether you live in one of the most industrialized countries of the world and are thinking of going vegetarian to live longer, healthier lives, or you live in a less wealthy country, food is still considered a moving and motivating issue. The two last centuries have focused on how to feed the planet&#39;s increasing population in ways that are sustainable and healthy at the same time. And this is the very key point of EXPO 2015. Alright expo lovers, you surely won’t be disappointed with the outcome. Make sure not to miss it!<br></p>
