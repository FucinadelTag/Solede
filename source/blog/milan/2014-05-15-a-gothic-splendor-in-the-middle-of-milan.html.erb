<p><strong>Piazza del Duomo </strong>is the heart of the city, both for geographic reasons and because of its artistic and cultural relevance. The construction of the cathedral dates back to <strong>1385</strong>, and it took 500 years (yes, 5 hundred years) to finish it. Several master builders were involved over the years in the activity and the initial design was regularly altered. The long-lasting construction period also led to a mixture of styles but the final result is impressively uniform, with a decidedly Gothic style.</p>

<p>The marble blocks were shipped from Candoglia, in Piedmont region, to Milan from the river Toce, along the Ticino and then the Naviglio Grande canal and finally into the city. During the XVI century even <strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong> was questioned for the construction of the Lantern tower, but its project seems a little avant-garde for Duomo, whose engineers aimed more at a homogeneous Gothic style.</p>

<p>If the weather is clear, don’t hesitate to climb up to the roof for a view of the city and, if not too foggy, you can even get breath-taking view of the Alps.</p>

<p>Atop the Duomo, <strong>La Madonnina</strong> dominates the city in all her splendor. Few people know that during the Second World War the statue was covered with rags by citizens so that enemies couldn’t see it from on high and bomb it. Thanks to the apprehensiveness of citizens during the centuries, this splendid statue has overcome bad weather conditions, wars and even theft attempts.<br></p>
