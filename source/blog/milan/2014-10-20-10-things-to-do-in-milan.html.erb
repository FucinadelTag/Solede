<p>Like what all tourists say, there&#39;s always too much to see but too little time! Milan has so much to offer, but if you haven’t a month-long vacation you have to focus on the important things to see and prioritise. Here are the 10 Milan activities we think you shouldn’t miss out to avoid those &#39;I can&#39;t believe you didn&#39;t see…&#39; moments.</p>

<p><strong>CLIMB TO THE ROOF OF DUOMO</strong></p>

<p class="block-img"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/solede/7e00127ce087e1c197e8c7cb6bb3847ebd36b680_milano_piazza_duomo_1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="418" /></p>

<p></p>

<p><br>Duomo of Milan is the first of those things that you&#39;ll regret missing when you get home. In the busy and vibrant Piazza Duomo features the main cathedral of Milan, that will strike you for its grandeur. 3,500 statues and 135 spires enrich the cathedral, with its Gothic façade made in pink Candoglia marble, shipped from Candoglia to Milan through an ingenious canal network system. It took almost 500 years to complete Duomo, but you will agree that the outcome is impressive. If the weather is clear, don’t think twice and climb up to the roof - take the lift or if you’re feeling brave 201 stairs are just waiting for you for a view of the city and, if not too foggy, for a breath-taking view of the Alps. This is definitely one of the stops you shouldn&#39;t skip in your list of the 10 Things To Do in Milan.</p>

<p><strong>SPEND 15 MINUTES WITH &quot;THE LAST SUPPER&quot;</strong></p>

<p class="block-img"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/solede/e3e1315008711a418ca5288433b3c6ce43dbd03c_ultima-cena.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="418" /></p>

<p></p>

<p><br>The Last Supper in the refectory of the convent Santa Maria delle Grazie is doubtless one of the greatest painting of the Renaissance. Leonardo da Vinci managed to capture the consternation among the Disciples when Jesus dropped the bombshell and said, “I say to you, one of you will betray me&quot;. Unfortunately, despite several restoration attempts, very little of the original painting remains today, due to the techniques used by the artist - Leonardo the inventor, instead of using tempera on wet plaster, thought he&#39;d give using dry plaster a whirl. The painting can be seen by groups of maximum 25 people for 15 minutes, but make sure to get tickets on time, as it can be incredibly difficult.</p>

<p><strong>STROLL DOWN VITTORIO EMANUELE II GALLERY</strong></p>

<p class="block-img"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/solede/2e4b51326b03f2aa23e349b5384f37136a4698af_galleria-vittorio-emanuele.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="419" /></p>

<p></p>

<p><br>Among the Top 10 Things To Do in Milan make sure to spare enough time for the fabulous Gallery. Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II - built in 1867 by the architect Giuseppe Mengoni, is an incredibly elegant steel-and-glass arcade in Belle Époque style. It was named after King Vittorio Emanuele II and connects Piazza della Scala to Piazza Duomo. Today the most high profile shops can be found here, and it is under this roof that Mario Prada opened his first shop in 1913. Before you leave, remember to &quot;step on the bull’s balls.&quot; Supposedly, turning your heel on the unfortunate bull’s genitals will bring you luck. </p>

<p><strong>VISIT LA SCALA OPERA HOUSE</strong></p>

<p class="block-img"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/solede/ff20038481a1919f851e25b610bb94c2c9b05673_la-scala.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="418" /></p>

<p></p>

<p><br>La Scala Theatre in Milan is one of the world’s great opera houses. Built in the late 1770s, the theater has seen premiers of extraordinarily well-loved operas, including works by Rossini, Puccini and Verdi. The word “scala” means “staircase” in Italian, but the theater gets its name because it stands where a church dedicated to Santa Maria della Scala used to stand. The theatre you will see was renovated first in 1907, and then in the mid-1940s after it was damaged by World War II bombs. Although getting tickets to a performance at La Scala can be rather expensive, you can check out La Scala Museum easily, as it’s definitely an impressive sight, whether you’re an opera lover or not. </p>

<p><strong>EXPLORE SFORZA CASTLE</strong></p>

<p class="block-img"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/solede/472abd8afc519a183aaf74538162a277a416ef64_castello-sforzesco-milano.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="418" /></p>

<p></p>

<p><br>The castle, built during the 14th century, was the main residence of Visconti family, and then the aristocratic Ludovico &#39;il Moro&#39; Sforza, succeeded. It was surrounded by a wide hunting ground - now known as Parco Sempione, one of the most beautiful and largest park of the city. Unfortunately, during the foreign dominations of Milan the castle was partially destroyed and used as a fortress by enemies: this is why it was long considered a mere emblem of power, foreign rulers and conquerors. The castle is now a fundamental part of the city, housing several city&#39;s museums and art collections. </p>

<p><strong>DISCOVER THE TREASURES OF BRERA</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p><br>Located in the prestigious building of the well known Academy of Fine Arts, Pinacoteca di Brera contains a truly impressive collection of the greatest italian paintings in the world. Among the masterpieces on display, you can admire works by Renaissance master painters, including Caravaggio, Raphael, Mantegna, Hayez and Tintoretto. When you are filled up with art and culture, you deserve a visit in the colorful Brera district. The picturesque streets lined with cute shops and corner restaurants will amaze you. This is undoubtedly a must-do among the Top 10 Things To Do in Milan.</p>

<p class="block-img"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/solede/6cd5a8860adc821ef0fdd399405a6be5e385f1ee_aperitivo.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="418" /></p>

<p></p>

There are tons of nice places to have aperitivo, but we suggest you to go to Brera district, one of the most picturesque and colorful of the city.

<p><strong>WANDER AROUND NAVIGLI</strong></p>

<p class="block-img"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/solede/c77d25528b24fc5966d186a448100a7438bc6e45_navigli-city.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="418" /></p>

<p></p>

<p><br>One of the most charismatic districts of Milan is without doubt the Navigli area. This is the name the Milanese give to the canals once connecting Milan to rivers. Back to the Middle Age, the city used to have a huge canal network stretching for several miles, but unfortunately most of it was filled in. Only two canals remain, giving birth to the heart of Milan’s most bohemian district – crowded with the best artists’ studios, bookshops, cafes and jazz bars.</p>

<p><strong>RELAX AT PARCO SEMPIONE</strong></p>

<p class="block-img"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/solede/dcbb62e2df02d496beb12ed0cfc95eb6600d3bff_parco-sempione1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="418" /></p>

<p></p>

<p><br>This romantic park is nicely laid out in an English landscape style with winding paths, open grassy areas, lawns, tall trees and a picturesque bridge across a central pond. Its origins date back to the fourteenth century, when the Visconti family ruled over Milan. This large area behind the castle was one the hunting ground of the family and was later expanded to become a garden. During foreign domination of Milan the area became neglected along with the castle. When the current park was created between 1890 and 1893 the local architect Emilio Alemagna decided to incorporate several structures, including Arco della Pace and Arena Civica - the mini-colosseum designed in 1806.</p>
