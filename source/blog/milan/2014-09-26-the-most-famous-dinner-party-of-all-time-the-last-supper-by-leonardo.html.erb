<p>Leonardo Da Vinci would have never imagined that his <em>The Last Supper</em>, c<strong>ommissioned for the convent Santa Maria delle Grazie of Milan in 1495</strong>, would survive over more than five centuries. Leonardo would have never imagined that his painting would suffer major damages because of humidity, the negligent work of bad restorers, and even because of bombing. Actually, he would have never imagined he would become probably the greatest genius of his century! The more Leonardo grew up, the more he became famous for his paintings and sculptures under the service of Florence, Milan, Venice, Rome, and even France. Of course, amongst his masterpieces, we can’t forget the star attraction of The Louvre - Mona Lisa, or one of the most significant  religious paintings of all time, <em>The Last Supper</em>.</p>

<p>Leonardo depicted Christ’s final meal with his apostles, in the exact instant when Jesus dropped the bombshell and said, “I say to you, one of you will betray me.&quot; The painting shows the different degrees of horror, anger, and shock of the disciples, displaying very human emotions - thanks to Leonardo’s ability to depict people acting like real people. It took Leonardo three years to finish it, and this is worth noting as Leonardo was a real procrastinator with a remarkable habit to leave projects uncompleted. <strong>The painting began to deteriorate</strong> and flake off the wall soon after it was completed - even in the XV century many people stated that the painting was completely ruined, and people have been attempting to restore it ever since. It was so unrecognizable that a door was even inserted into the refectory right in the middle of that wall where Leonardo had painted Christ's feet! </p>

<p>Several enigmas and theories have arisen across the centuries surrounding the famous painting, but the assertions of <strong>Dan Brown in </strong><strong><em>The Da Vinci Code</strong></em> are surely the most vivid among us. Who is the character to the right of Jesus, John or Mary Magdalene? And, what about the story of the wrong number of hands? Are these hidden mysteries, or can we find a reasonable answer to the enigmas? Unfortunately for Brown, art historians soon got rid of all cryptic messages supposedly incorporated by Leonardo into his artwork and gave a reasonable answer to Brown’s hypothesis: No, no enigma here.
