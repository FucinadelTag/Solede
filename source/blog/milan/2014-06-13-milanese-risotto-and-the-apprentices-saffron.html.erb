<p>Yes, you will never tell that Milan, with its business-like look has a long tradition of cooking. In fact, its traditional cuisine has ancient origins and over time it has been influenced not only by the local products - like rice growing and cattle, but also by the different foreign rulers that occupied Milan. </p>

<p>The most important thing to know about Milanese cuisine is that it is a really simple cuisine, made of vegetables, beef and cereals, cooked and seasoned with butter.</p>

<p> 
Well then, now that we understand the origin and key points of the traditional cuisine of Milan we can move on to outlining the typical traditional dish of Milan, <strong>the legendary Risotto alla Milanese</strong>, made with saffron. </p>

<p>A funny legend stands behind this Risotto: in <strong>1574</strong>, while the famous Duomo di Milano was being constructed, a Master Glazer, Valerio di Fiandra was in charge of creating the stained glass windows. In order to obtain brighter yellows, saffron was used for the stained glass. </p>

<p>One of Valerioâ€™s apprentice wanted to make a funny joke to his Master: Valerio's daughter was to get married, and what better occasion to sprinkle a little yellow powder in the risotto for the wedding feast? He never thought that the guests would enjoy the saffron rice dish but they loved it, and this is how Risotto alla Milanese, with its secret ingredient, was born.
