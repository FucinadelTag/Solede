<p class="abstract">The famous glass-vaulted arches of the Galleria, formally known as “Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II”, connects two of Milan’s most famous attractions, the Duomo and La Scala. This forerunner to our modern day malls simultaneously allowed you to take a shortcut, shelter from the rain, shop and dine.</p>

<p>This architectural gem of the XIX century was conceived to refresh the urban image of Milan after the Unification of Italy. <strong>Architect Giuseppe Mengoni</strong> was in charge of the construction of a passage to connect Piazza del Duomo with Piazza della Scala in grand style. After studying the covered passages of Paris, he proposed a luxury, glass vaulted arcade, named after the first king of united Italy. The king was invited to Milan for the Gallery inauguration, but he let Milanese people know that he wouldn’t be present. Mengoni was so upset for that: why did the king decide not to come and see the masterpiece named after him? Maybe he didn’t like it? This is probably the reason why the day before the inauguration Mengoni decided to commit suicide from the roof of the gallery he had built. The king let Milanese people know that he felt too sick to reach Milan, but the news arrived too late for Mengoni.</p>

<p>After this sad accident, the gallery was filled with the most glamour shops and bars for the upper echelons of Milan society. Shops changed over the years, but only one shop has seen the passing of one and a half centuries: <strong>Campari</strong>. This bar opened the same day the Galleria was inaugurated and immediately became a very classy bar where artists used to meet. Galleria is also at the heart of one of the world’s most famous brand, Prada: <strong>Mario Prada</strong> opened his first boutique here, from where he started his fashion empire. To celebrate the centenary of its very first boutique, the Italian fashion house launched the Prada Galleria project and Milan kicked Mac Donalds out of Galleria and welcomed a second Prada shop, exclusively for menswear. So, <em>arrivederci</em> mc muffins, <em>benvenuti</em> Prada suits!</p>

<p>Right underneath the glass dome is the <strong>emblem of Turin, a bull</strong>, on the mosaic floor. It is meant to bring you good luck if you spin around on your right heel on the bull&#39;s most treasured possession. I’m not kidding you if I say that there is a crowd of people queuing up to crush the testicles of the bull of Turin, in order to bring themselves good luck. This is not a simple “tourist tradition” reported on tourist guides. Milan and Turin have long been rivals, so Milanese did not accept a symbol of their bitter enemy, Turin, in their gallery. Every time they crossed the gallery they squeezed the bull’s genitals, to insult the rival city. Curious how the tradition started.<br></p>
