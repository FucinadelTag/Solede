<p>If you have ever been to Como, you surely must have fallen in love with the city. But what is so special about it? Maybe the presence of the lake, with its splendid villas? Or the surrounding mountains and hills that envelop the city? Could it be the <strong>medieval center of Como</strong>, with its majestic Duomo and small alleys? Possibly, it’s the harmony of these elements mixed up so naturally as they have always been there together.</p>

<p>The reputation of Lake Como as a beautiful retreat started at the end of the XVIII century, when the majority of the villas on the shores of the lake were built as summer residences for the Italian and foreign aristocracy. The magnificent <strong>Villa d’Este in Cernobbio</strong> was, for instance, a renaissance patrician residence, now hosting a luxury hotel. </p>

<p>If you like <strong>walking in the middle of nature</strong>, Como will fully satisfy you. Several itineraries lead either through the woody hills along the old paths or to the most panoramic heights of the mountains along the lake. Each itinerary has its own features with historical, artistic and natural paths to explore. Most of them are easy to walk, some are more demanding. You don’t need to climb mountains or walk for long to enjoy a stunning panoramic view from high atop the mountain.  A funicular climbs up the hillside and arrives in the quiet village of Brunate, offering a splendid view of the city and the lake below.</p>

<p>Many reasons make this city famous worldwide: its natural beauty, historic monuments, and courteous people. You just need to visit Como to find the reasons you will want to visit it again. <br></p>
