<p class="abstract">Fashion is so much a part of Milanese culture that the first thing one would possibly know about the city is “Versace” or “Armani”.</p>

<p>With several fashion agencies and institutes, catwalks and fashion weeks, the importance of fashion industry in Milan is unquestionably. Milan has major shopping areas all over the city to suit everybody&#39;s fancy: which one you choose for your shopping depends on how much money you&#39;re ready to blow. The most fashionable (and expensive) shopping hubs is the <strong>Fashion Quadrangle, enclosed by four intersecting streets</strong> - Via Montenapoleone, Via della Spiga, Via Manzoni and Corso Venezia. You'll easily find shops from luxury labels such as Gucci, Armani, Valentino and Dolce & Gabbana.</p>

<p>Stroll down via Montenapoleone - a 500 meters road crowded with the most fabulous fashion brands, from clothes to accessories to jewelry. Even if you don’t have tons of money to spend, it’s definitely worth paying a visit to see the <strong>amazing window displays, considered a true art form</strong>. For instance, Beautiful Sicily often takes over in Dolce&Gabbana shop windows to celebrate Domenico Dolce’s origins: colourful fruit crates, old style vespas and flat caps to stress the designers’ bond with South of Italy. </p>

<p>Shopping around the district, everyone would feel a little bit like a top model or a fashion designer. Elegant ladies with perfectly sprayed hair not moving an inch walking by the arm of stylish dressed men in tailored made suits of the finest fabric. Young slim girls dressed in the latest fashion moving skilfully on their stilettos. In a city that feels more like a big catwalk swarming with models, the risk is that historical and cultural beauty of Milan may be blurred by clothes and jewelry.
