<p>If you are a Christmas period lover you might be also fond of the typical Christmas markets. North of the Alps, the so called Christkindlmarkts (in German the equivalent of Christ Child Market) take place every year during the four weeks of Advent and bustle the main squares of the cities and the neighbouring pedestrian areas with their traditional stalls. The first documents mentioning these peculiar and joyful December markets date back to the Late Middle Age and interest most of the cities belonging to the former Holy Roman Empire (the first in Vienna was held in 1294, in Munich and in Bautzen around 1310, then Dresden in 1434 and Augsburg in 1498). As far as Italy is concerned, the most famous Christmas markets take place in the German-speaking areas and mainly in South Tirol cities such as Bolzano, Merano, Brixen, Sterzing and Bruneck. <br>A special exception in Northern Italy is represented by Milan, where the citizens celebrate their patron, Saint Ambrose, (339-397 AD) on 7th December. The anniversary is immediately followed by the feast of the Immaculate Conception (on 8th December) and in the Ambrosian Dioceses it is a perfect period to take a short break from daily activities. Often you might have the chance of a long week-end which can either be spent by the Milanese on the nearby mountains to enjoy the first snow, or remaining in town in the warm, friendly atmosphere, which animates the “Oh bej! Oh bej!” fair.</p>

<h3><strong>Milanese Christmas&#39;s tradition: Oh Bej!</strong></h3>

<p>According to the legend, the introduction of this peculiar Milanese Christmas Market dates back to 1510, when Giannetto Castiglione, Grand Master of the Order of the Saints Maurizio and Lazzaro, was sent by the Pope Pius IV in Milan to reawaken the citizens faith in the saints. Worried by the possible reactions of the sceptical population, Giannetto made a stop on his way to Milan to purchase lots of gifts and sweets for the Milanese. Once in the city, his colorful procession was followed by the entire population and Giannetto finally reached the Basilica of Saint Ambrose in a festive mood. In fact the fair’s name refers to the dialect expression used by the Milanese children while opening their gifts: “Oh bej! Oh bej!”, which means “How beautiful! How beautiful!”. Since then the fair was always held in different areas of the city center of Milan; until 1886 in Piazza dei Mercanti (in the surroundings of the Duomo), from 1886 to 2006 in the district of the Sant’Ambrogio Basilica and in the last decade the fair has been relocated in the more spacious area of the Sforza Castle. This year the “Oh bej! Oh bej!” will be held from the 5th to the 8th December 2015 and more than 400 stalls will be housed in the area of the Sforza Castle and of the adjacent Sempione Park. Taking a stroll around the stalls is an absolute must for those who are in Milan in those days. The range of gastronomical and handicraft products is huge and they usually represent a perfect solution for Christmas’s gifts. At the same time, people fight the cold weather eating the traditional roasted chestnuts, drinking some hot vin brûlé (mulled wine), while the entertainment is assured by the market traders, who still love to attract customers attention by shouting loudly the dialect expression: “Oh bej! Oh bej!”.</p>
