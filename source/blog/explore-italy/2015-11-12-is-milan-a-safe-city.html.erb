<p>Is Milan a safe city? This doubt could arise in someone&#39;s mind fascinated by the idea of visiting the Italian capital of fashion. The options to get informed, nowadays are many: from the most common “word of mouth” to the several platforms on the web where users from all over the world can share their personal experiences and opinions. From our milanese headquarter, the Solede&#39;s team can happily assure that in principle, like any major city in Europe, Milan offers a safe urban environment. </p>

<h3>Milan in The Safe Cities Index 2015</h3>

<p>According to the recent list of the most secure cities in the world drawn up by the Economist (<a href="http://safecities.economist.com/whitepapers/safe-cities-index-white-paper/">The Safe Cities Index 2015</a>), Milan holds the 26th position. The report is based on an index composed of more than 40 quantitative and qualitative indicators divided in four thematic categories: health security; digital security; infrastructure safety and personal safety. Thanks to this investigation, Milan confirms its regular position in the global panorama (even if significantly behind other large European cities) and gains the first place within the national context. </p>

<h3>Lights and shadows</h3>

<p>The proper city of Milan has a population of about 1.3 million, while its urban area counts 5,264,000 people. Like in any large and crowded town, with its lights and shadows, in Milan you can hear about cases of pickpocketings or baiting attempts by suspicious characters. Anyhow, to run into the respective situations can be caused by a lack of normal caution or just bad luck and the problem of safety isn’t a major topic for Milan citizens. Essentially the areas of the milanese metropolitan where you can meet with unpleasant situations are two: the city centre, in correspondence with the main touristic and most crowded attractions (Piazza del Duomo, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, Castello Sforzesco, Stazione Centrale), and the suburbs. In the first case the number of pickpockets increases proportionally to the chaotic liveliness of the area, while in the second case the threat is represented by the state of decline of the neighborhoods. However, the suburbs of Milan at the moment are object of an urban regeneration promoted by the community with the support of smart teams of architects. In conclusion, the recommendation for the future visitor of Milan is to leave at home all state of anxiety, use common sense and keep eyes open to avoid pickpockets, but primarily to discover all the beauties hidden in the city!</p>
