<p>If you are travelling to Italy for the first time in your life, the best thing for you is to be prepared and know what to expect to experience Italy at the fullest! Whether you are visiting enchanting medieval cities in Tuscany, white sand beaches in Puglia or the natural treasures of the Dolomites, Italy will amaze you for its beauty and magic which you won’t find anywhere else. If you are a conscious consumer and give value to your money, some advice might be helpful in order not to be caught by surprise.</p>

<h3></h3>

<h3><strong>Ok! The price is right!</strong></h3>

<p class="block-img"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/solede/cf42078998adb982a9f85236b4a9c3777dff1b57_conto-barista.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="513" /></p>

<p>If your destination for your holiday in Italy is a touristic city or area, you should keep a watchful eye on prices. Restaurants and cafés might be much more expensive than they should be in very central and touristic areas: in many of these places you are not actually paying for sublime product quality or service, but mostly for the exclusive location. If you want to be an aware consumer, here is our list of average prices for some daily expenses you might have during your holiday to Italy: </p>

<p>- Pizza at restaurant or pizzeria is around 6/7 Euros.</p>

<p>- A pasta dish, let&#39;s say penne with tomato sauce, should cost no more than 10 Euros. If more, we can consider the restaurant quite expensive </p>

<p>- Espresso coffee standing up at the counter can vary between 0,70 cents and 1 euro. If you sit at the table you will pay for service and &quot;coperto&quot; (the cover charge)</p>

<p>- At a café, a small bottle of water costs around 1 Euro. Natural spring water costs as much as sparkling water. If you find a supermarket, we suggest you to buy water there.</p>

<p>- Entering in a Gelateria, a small cup of gelato may cost from 1,50 to 2,60 Euros.</p>

<p></p>

<h3><strong>Watch out for pickpockets!</strong></h3>

<p class="block-img"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/solede/0cf70f5617c142c794c958d7046171a8146fda27_pickpockets.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="514" /></p>

<p>In some parts of Italy, particularly in big cities, purse-snatching and pickpocketing can be quite an issue. Crowded places like stations, airports, buses and tourist areas are the best hunting grounds for pickpockets, who can act undisturbed while inattentive tourists are looking at their map, waiting right in the middle of a queue, or looking for the right stop of their bus.<br>We are not saying that you should watch your back for the entire trip, but few tips may help you not to have your holiday to Italy completely ruined by these unpleasant petty thefts.</p>

<p>Firts of all, be discreet. Avoid putting your wallet in the back pocket of your jeans where it can be easily seen (and taken) by any malicious person; for the same reason, your backpack front pocket is not the good hiding place to secure your cash and plastics either. We suggest you to put your wallet, passport, cash and plastics in a fanny pack, or at the bottom of your backpack. Make sure that the zip of your bag or backpack is always perfectly closed and check it several times during the day. Keep a close eye on your belongings!</p>

<p>Our second suggestion is that there is no need to carry your passport, car licence or prescriptions everywhere you go: make photocopies of important documents and store them in a separate part of your luggage. During your daily tours, take with you only things you are going to need: you may consider leaving at hotel your laptop, passport or additional cash you may not need. In Italy we like to say “prevenire è meglio che curare”, which means “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”.</p>

<h3><strong>Using ATMs in Italy</strong></h3>

<p class="block-img"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/solede/f92bc314c3a99c9f9a99067c56686e2605c3ddd6_dx_bancomat.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="515" /></p>

<p>Before leaving to Italy, pay your bank a visit and inform them of your trip and destination, so they won’t put a block on your cards when oversea. Ask the bank what is the transaction fee you are going to pay for each time you use an ATM, and if there is a currency conversion charged every time you withdraw money. If you are charged for every transaction, then withdraw larger amounts every time you make a visit to the ATM, so you’ll go fewer times! </p>

<p>Throughout Italy you will find ATMs to get your cash. In big cities you will find ATMs at every corner, especially in central areas. On the contrary, if you are visiting small villages off the beaten path, you may find only one ATM in the entire village. ATMs are called Bancomat in Italy and they are really easy to use, since you can choose the language preferred as soon as you insert your card. You’ll be asked to insert your PIN by digits, so make sure to know it and type it correctly! The ATM will withdraw money directly from your bank account at home, convert it into Euro and give you cash. It&#39;s as easy as that!</p>

<h3><strong>To tip or not to tip, that is the question</strong></h3>

<p class="block-img"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/solede/6598be0b9a2fb89d31b5fc04fac8301a4395b8e1_mancia.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="475" /></p>

<p>You may have read or heard several things about tips in Italy, and you might feel a bit confused or not know what to really do when facing a waiter. We’d like to face the issue from the Italian point of view, so our suggestion is to relax, this is not a really big issue for us, so feel free to do what you want to do. First of all, tips are not compulsory at all in Italy, nor common. Waiters in regular restaurants would never expect a tip from their Italian customers, and this is simply because Italians don’t tip that much, even when they have particularly appreciated the food and service: they would pay many compliments on the cooking, leave a positive review on Tripadvisor, but few of them would leave a tip. This does not mean that Italians never tip at all but even when travelling abroad, waiters do not expect generous tips from Italians.<br></p>

<p>Reading your bill at the restaurant you might be puzzled finding 1 or 2 euros per person to be paid under the entry “il coperto”. This is the cover charge and if you read it on your bill, do not think you have been ripped off by the restaurant, since this is the price for occupying their territory for a bit.</p>

<h3><strong>Cash is Italy’s best friend</strong></h3>

<p class="block-img"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/solede/2e04ea4416272f5d971de5a5ce7b521d11cb70e0_cash.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="514" /></p>

<p>Although debit and credit cards have gain acceptance in Italy and almost everyone under the age of 60 has a plastic or two, it is still weird for Italians to pay by card for a coffee at a bar or for bread at the grocery, and this can even have a jarring effect on the seller, who would ask you if you really do not have some coins to pay for that. This may not occur in big cities like Rome, Milan, Venice or Florence, but as long as you travel away from the bustle, you may find restaurants, grocery stores and shops which balk when you try to hand them a Visa. <br>For those of you who are accustomed to paying for their coffee at Starbucks with a debit card, we strongly suggest to always keep some cash with you during your holiday in Italy. </p>
