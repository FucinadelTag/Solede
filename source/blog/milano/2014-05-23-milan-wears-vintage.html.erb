<p>Milan, the capital of fashion, luxury and shopping. Milan is often synonym of catwalks and luxury brands, but if you try to go beyond its glamour you will see a city full of vintage collections, retro clothing stores and chic old school designs. Wandering about Fashion district you will never tell that this city has vintage pearls to offer you, and that there are districts in Milan where vintage boutiques outnumber luxury brands. Here are our picks for the best in town.
Brera district, in the heart of Milan, is absolutely the perfect location for the coolest vintage stores, where owners of small shops handpick fashion-forward pieces. Cavalli e Nastri is with any doubt one of the most impressive vintage shops of Brera: you can find everything from a beautiful 1950s Dior cocktail dress to ‘70s jewelry, from designer dresses to homewear.
Then, if after Brera you are still craving vintage, why don’t you stroll around Navigli district, the canals of Milan? Whether you’re looking for vintage furniture, kitschy yet functional wall art or tasteful accents for your home, Navigli never fails to find the right piece for you. Losing yourself in these streets means savoring the taste of the old Milan, among courtyards to explore and corners where time seems to stand still. </p>
