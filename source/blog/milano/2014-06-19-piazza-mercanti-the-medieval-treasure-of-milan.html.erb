<p>This picturesque square was the beating heart of commercial and governmental life of the 13th century. Just imagine this square as buzzing with daily markets and activities: hair cutters, goldsmiths, cutlers, seamstresses, weavers, tailors and bakers made their daily jobs in this rectangular square. The six gates and streets adjacent to the Piazza took their names from the main city trades at that time: Spadari (sword makers), Armorari (arms makers), Orefici (goldsmiths), Cappellari(hatters), Fustagnari (fustian workers) and Speronari (spur makers).
The large arcades in the Piazza is Loggia degli Osii, which housed offices of notaries and judges. From its balcony weddings, edicts and sentences were announced. You will notice on it an eagle symbolizing the justice in between the image of two snakes, symbol of the city.
Next to the Loggia there is Palazzo delle Scuole Palatine, which was the seat of the most prestigious higher school of medieval Milan. Many notable Milanese scholars of different ages studied or taught in these schools. 
Right in front of you there is Palace of Reason, the administrative building and judicial seat of the city, and it consists in an open ground floor for meetings of the population and one upstairs for meetings of the Council. A strange feature of the columns will amaze you: if one stands in the corner of the loggia and speaks, even quietly, facing the columns, anyone standing in the opposite angle next to the column can hear exactly what was said. It is told that merchants used this intriguing method of conversation to exchange business details undercover.
After this virtual tour of Piazza dei Mercanti, you are ready to see it with our eyes.</p>
