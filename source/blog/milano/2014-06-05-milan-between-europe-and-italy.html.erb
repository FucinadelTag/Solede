<p class="abstract">Unofficial capital of the country or not, it may take you a while to appreciate the magnetic charm of Milan. Right in the middle of Northern Italy, many think this city feels more European than Italian: churches, alleys and ancient ruins seems to be outnumbered by banks, offices and skyscrapers.</p>

<p>With something almost Northern European in the air, Milan is Italy&#39;s most cosmopolitan city, very business-like in appearance. In fact, many large national banks and companies are headquartered here and the city is even preparing to stage the <strong>World Expo 2015</strong>, the universal exhibition whose object will be “feeding the planet, energy for life. </p>

<p>Milan is trying to give the best of itself for this event, with major works under way. Sometimes the improvements of the city for Expo are regarded with great suspicion by citizens, such as <strong>Expo Gate</strong> - the new Expo info point, just a few steps from Sforza Castle: it consists of two identical, mirrored structures of metal and glass that rise on the natural view from the Duomo, through Via Dante, to the castle.</p>

<p>Sometimes major works for Expo are just a chance to make those big changes that have always been post-poned, like the construction of the fifth subway line - the purple line, or the improving of the cycling lanes outside the city. </p>

<p>This unexpected metamorphosis of Milan, be it well-accepted or not, is certainly a sign of <strong>creativity and spirit for innovation</strong>, a glimpse to the future and to Europe. True, at first glance Milan may not look like the classic Italian city, but let’s try to go beyond its appearance and discover that under the surface of a cosmopolitan metropolis stays a city you will soon fall in love with.
