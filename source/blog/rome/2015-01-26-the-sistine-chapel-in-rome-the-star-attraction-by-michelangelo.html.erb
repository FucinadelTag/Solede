<p class="abstract">You surely must have heard about the Sistine Chapel, but you probably aren’t really sure about what it actually is. Yes, of course it is a chapel (we at least know that from the name), but if you are interested in art or are planning a trip to Rome, you definitely should learn more about it.</p>

<p><strong>Rome has countless great works of art spread throughout</strong>. Walking around the city, you have about the same chance of winding up in front of some ancient ruin or pillar as you have of winding up in front of a bench or utility pole in your own city. No one has probably ever counted the number of archeological sites and works of art scattered around Rome, just because there are too many! But one site is really worth your visit to Rome: the Sistine Chapel. <strong>The Sistine Chapel </strong>takes its name from the man who commissioned it, Pope Sixtus IV – “Sixtus” in Italian is “Sisto.” Do not freak out after reading the number of people who visit it and the Vatican Museums: some 25,000 people a day, or five million people a year. The Sistine Chapel is more than just Vatican City’s most popular tourist destination; here you can find some of the most famous (and most parodied) paintings in the world!</p>

<p class="block-img"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/solede/d2ad4f0ab946cae8a0f2155e64d606507a38f406_cappella_sistina.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="360" /></p>

<p><strong>The ceiling of the Chapel is the real attraction</strong>, along with its brilliant fresco, “The Last Judgment,” painted by a rising young sculptor named Michelangelo. You may wonder what the fresco depicts: the answer is “a lot.” There are scenes from the Book of Genesis – from the Creation, to the Fall, to shortly after Noah&#39;s deluge. There are immense portraits of prophets on either side of the scenes and then smaller figures of ignudi scattered through the fresco. All these are found inside a fresco 131 feet long by 43 feet wide. Now, you may think that Michelangelo had had a lot of experience as a painter before creating such a great masterpiece; in fact, <strong>Michelangelo</strong> wasn’t actually a painter but a sculptor instead (remember “David” by Michelangelo in Florence? It’s also his). He referred to himself as a sculptor, but we must admit that he wasn’t bad at all with colors! Contrary to myth, Michelangelo did not really paint lying on his back but on scaffolding of his own invention, which was sturdy enough to hold workers and materials and allowed him to stand upright. However, Michelangelo often had to bend backwards and paint over his head – that must have made his neck and back burn painfully. </p>

<p>What is the Sistine Chapel now used for? Since 1492, <strong>new popes have been selected here in this chapel</strong>. The cardinals gather to vote, and once they come to an agreement (usually after a few days) a chimney in the roof of the chapel announces their results, with white smoke indicating the election of a pope and black smoke signaling that no candidate has yet received a two-thirds majority.</p>
