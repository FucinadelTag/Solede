<p>The Earth likes to praise the wisdom of civilizations that have achieved or dared too much by subduing them by natural forces. And this is what happened to <strong>Pompeii, a powerful Roman town at the foot of Mount Vesuvius</strong>. 150 miles south from Rome, Pompeii was flourishing and prosperous and had all it needed to become a powerful city in the Roman Empire: sun, financial prosperity, and brilliant brains. What else would a city need back in the A.D. 79? Oh yes, we shouldn’t forget the Vesuvius Volcano! Its shocking proximity wasn’t the wisest idea for Pompeii’s founding fathers, and the citizens of the beautiful town understood why on the morning of August 24, A.D. 79, when <strong>Vesuvius violently exploded</strong>. Throughout the day and night, the Volcano spewed waves of thick ash, hot rock, and sulfuric gas into the air and over the towns of Pompeii, Herculaneum and Stabiae.  There is no place to hide when nature unleashes its destructive power. People were suffocated, burned and buried in ash several feet thick. Tons of ash and rock filled the towns, until nothing remained to be seen of the once healthy Roman city.</p>

<p>For almost 1700 years, <strong>the city remained hidden and was slowly forgotten</strong> and erased from history, until in 1748 a group of explorers rediscovered the site, and much to their surprise, underneath a thick layer of dust and debris, the city of Pompeii was mostly intact! Now the formerly forgotten city of Pompeii offers an accurate picture of life in a prosperous Roman town 2,000 years ago. Homes, bathhouses, food stores, furnishings, bronze statues, and mosaics can all be seen – along with the plaster casts of victims. Pompeii is now an open-air museum of extraordinary charm, and <a href="http://www.solede.com/rome/naples--pompeii-day-tour/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=articolo%20blog&utm_campaign=The%20Roman%20Pompeii%3A%20a%20layer%20of%20ash%20to%20hush%20a%20city">can be visited daily with our tours</a></p>
