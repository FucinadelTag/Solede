                        <i><p>If you want to visit Milan as real Milanese people do, moving comfortably but avoiding big touristic buses, this tour is the good one for you. The charm of Milanese yellow-trams is definitely unrivaled in elegance and history; moreover, they are the only authorized vehicles to drive in some limited traffic areas, where buses are not allowed. Enjoy a must do of any visit to Milan, Leonardo da Vinci’s fresco, The Last Supper. With a pre-reserved entry time, we guarantee you to see it and avoid waiting in endless lines. </p>

<h3><strong>What will I visit?</strong></h3>

<p>A sure highlight of any visit to Milan is The Last Supper. Leonardo da Vinci left his mark in Milan with drawings and inventions, but none of these can overpass this world-known fresco. Leonardo depicted Christ’s final meal with his apostles in such a passionate and vivid way that it is still considered a masterpiece of psychological realism. In order to preserve the fresco from deterioration, only 25-30 people are allowed to enter the room at a time. As a result, tickets are often impossible to book and most tourists don’t manage to make a reservation in advance. With a pre-reserved entry time we guarantee you to see The Last Supper. After the visit have a walk to Sforza Castle: over the centuries, this majestic castle has been a defence fortress, a residence, military barracks and finally the site of cultural institutions. Your guide will wisely explain you the transformations of one of the most representative and popular monuments of the city.</p>

<p>Then it’s time to hop on tram number 1. This route is considered the sightseeing one of Milan, a way to see the major cultural and fashion attractions from your comfortable seat. Since the first trams had driven around Milan in 1876, they became an undeniable symbol of the city. During the itinerary you will pass Piazza Cordusio with its beautiful palaces and stop to admire the gothic Duomo, the gorgeous Gallery Vittorio Emanuele II and the neoclassic La Scala Opera House. Then catch the tram and head to the fashion district, then to the skyscraper business area of Piazza della Repubblica. </p>

<h3><strong>Why should I take this tour?</strong></h3>

<p>Milan&#39;s magic and charm may not be immediate for a tourist, but once discovered they may be even greater than those found in many other Italian cities. Isn&#39;t it better to see the very best of Milan as local people do?.</p></i>
