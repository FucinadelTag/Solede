                        <i><p>Discover Milan in a half-day walking tour and get introduced to this stylish Italian city. Enjoy Milan in the most special way and you'll find out that this city is not only rich in monuments, museums and masterpieces but also in magical, unknown spots. On your half-day walking tour you'll visit the breathtaking Duomo, one of the world's largest, most striking Gothic cathedrals. Next, you'll tour the glamorous Galleria Vittorio Emanuele shopping gallery and the medieval Sforza Castle, with its romantic park. You'll also visit the fabulous La Scala, one of the world's best known opera houses. </p>

<p>Meet your guide in Piazza Duomo (near Mondadori bookshop), in the center of the town, and then begin your 3-hour and a half walking tour. As you walk along these fascinating roads and residential palaces, an experienced local guide will point out Milan's main attractions, unknown and magical spots.</p>

<p>Some of the top attractions include the gothic Duomo - the third largest catholic church in the world, built in over five centuries, and the glamorous Vittorio Emanuele II Gallery - a 19th century glass-vaulted arcade, surmounted by a spectacular dome. The tour will continue with the Sforza Castle, the Fortress of Milan: this impressive Medieval Castle has in the inside several magnificent internal courts. You'll also visit the fabulous La Scala, one of the world's best known opera houses. Your entrance ticket provides admission to the theater and museum.</p>

<p>Learn about the history of Milan and its courtly intrigues from our local guide. Discover the anectodes of many leading personalities that dwelled in Milan, like Leonardo da Vinci, the composer Giuseppe Verdi and the novelist Alessandro Manzoni.</p>

<p>This half-day walking tour is perfect if you are staying in Milan for a short time, if you would like a unique experience or if you don’t like joining large and crowded groups.</p></i>
