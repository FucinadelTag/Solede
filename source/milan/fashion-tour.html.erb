                        <i><p>If you love fashion and shopping, this 3-hour walking tour will offer you a privileged look inside the Milan fashion world! Milan’s fashion district, known as Quadrilatero della Moda, is internationally known for its style and glamor. This elegant neighborhood is home to the world’s leading fashion designers, who have spread their shops over famous streets, like Via Montenapoleone and Via della Spiga. Discover the best brands in the world, such as Gucci and Armani, in a tour of Milan’s top fashion boutiques and streets, accompanied by our expert guide that will give you precious style tips and advice.</p>

<p>Meet your guide in Via Croce Rossa, in the center of the town, and then begin your 3-hour walking tour of Quadrilatero della Moda – Milan’s leading fashion district. As you pass Piazza San Fedele, via Manzoni or via Montenapoleone, learn from your guide about the history of these sumptuous palaces.</p>

<p>The elegant mansions and palatial-looking architecture that you will admire during the tour date back to the 17th century. At the beginning of the 19th century this area was already considered one of the most elegant in Italy, and this is the reason why the wealthiest fashion houses decided to lay down their roots in Milan’s chic neighborhood.</p>

<p>Walk down Via Montenapoleone – the legendary street of Milan’s fashion quadrangle, home to Cartier, Luis Vuitton and Bulgari, and then stop in Via Sant’Andrea for pictures at Palazzo Morando, an elegant 18th century mansion beautifully decorated and furnished. Along Via della Spiga, less crowded and quieter, stop and glance at the exclusive shop windows filled with designs you won’t find anywhere but here and on the catwalks. The shops themselves are showplaces, many designed by top names of the Italian architecture panorama. All the big names are here - Armani, Fendi, Missoni, Valentino, Trussardi, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, Versace, Hermès and Dior, but look also for less familiar names.</p>

<p>Learn about the prestigious designers from your guide that will be happy to give you precious style tips and shopping advice. If you’d like, you can even relax in some of the gorgeous cafés you will find on the itinerary.</p>

<p>Stroll down Piazza San Babila, and then finish your tour with a walk through near Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, with its luxury glass-vaulted arcades.</p>

<p>After this introduction to the Milan fashion industry, armed with insider info, say goodbye to the guide and take your time to shop in the city.</p></i>
