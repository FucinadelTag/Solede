                        <i><p>Savor the flavors of Italy on a 3-hour walking tour of Milan, led by a food-loving local guide! Sample Milan’s legendary dishes while learning the history of the city. You will be wandering the atmospheric streets of Milan with a local guide that will tell you about Italian cuisine and tradition. Italian Pizza and artisan Beer are among the several mouthwatering bites you get to try along the way. Explore the colorful history of Milan as you tour, accompanied by our expert guide that will wisely mix history and food, culture and fun.</p>

<p>Meet your guide in Lanza Underground Station, in the center of the town, and then begin your 3-hour food walking tour of the city. Learn about the history of the sumptuous palaces you will pass by, in the city that was home to cutting-edge chefs and passionate sommeliers, like Gualtiero Marchesi and Alberto Piras.</p>

<p>Milan's cuisine has evolved over the centuries, but many original dishes remain the same. For instance, Milanese Cutlet and Risotto have ancient origins: as a matter of fact, they were listed as “lompolos cum panito” in a banquet given in 1134 for the canon of Milan's St. Ambrogio Cathedral.</p>

<p>In between walking and talking, enjoy some food stops to try some of the city specialties, learn about the traditions of Milanese cuisine and discover classic specialties like Ossobuco (cross-cut veal shanks braised with vegetables, white wine and broth) and Panzerotti of Luini’bakery, an institution amongst the home-made bakeries in Milan. Taste Milan local dishes, but also traditional Italian specialties, like the authentic gelato and the best espresso coffee in town. Match the food with artisan Italian beers or Italian wines known worldwide: whether you are a wine lover or a beer expert, you will find the wine that better suits your taste and the beer you prefer for strength and flavor.</p>

<p>You can relax in some of the gorgeous cafés you will find on the itinerary or you can enjoy a Milan-style aperitivo (the Italian ritual of going out for a pre-dinner drink, combined with a generous buffet to please your appetite) in one of the trendiest bar of the city.</p>

<p>After three hours exploring Milan and its atmospheric eateries, head back for Lanza Station, where your tour finishes.</p></i>
