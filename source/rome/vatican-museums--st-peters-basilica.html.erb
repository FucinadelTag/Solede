                        <i><p>With 2000 rooms filled with the most extensive collection of art in the world, the Vatican Museums can be a little overwhelming. With a carefully planned itinerary through the Museums and an experienced guide at hand, it will be much easier to focus on the best artworks. With Skip-the-Line Access, you will visit the most famous rooms, such as the Raphael Rooms and Sistine Chapel. The last stop of your Vatican tour focuses on St Peter&#39;s Basilica, the world’s most impressive dome.</p>

<p><strong>What will I visit?</strong></p>

<p>Dig a little deeper into the beauty of Vatican and visit the two must-see attractions, Vatican Museums and St. Peter’s Basilica. As they are listed in every guidebook of Rome and the Vatican, lines to visit them usually stretches for hours. Our Skip the Line Access gets you directly into the heart of the Vatican Museums. With an expert guide leading the way, you will marvel at the sight of the Sistine Chapel, one of the most famous and visited sites in the world and the most emblematic example of papal patronage during the Renaissance period. As you walk, your guide will be ready to give you some tips on what to look out for in Michelangelo’s world known frescoes, from ‘The Last Judgment’ to ‘The Creation of Adam’ on the ceiling. Along the tour, you will see more art jewels such as the Pio Clementino halls with the Laocoon and Apollo Belvedere, the Candelabra and Maps Galleries.<br>The second highlight of the day is St. Peter’s Basilica, where you’ll be blown away by the size and beauty of the world’s biggest ancient cathedral. Step inside and admire the world famous sculpture La Pietà by Michelangelo and the extremely impressive Bernini’s altar, a monumental baldacchino of twisted wood and bronze. Once your tour is finished, your guide will lead you outside to St. Peter’s Square where you will enjoy the ability of Bernini, one of Rome’s best architects and artists.</p>
