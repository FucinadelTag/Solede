                        <i><p>See the top attractions of Rome on our incredible sightseeing day, combining two of our most loved tours - save money too! Start your day with a skip-the-line tour of the Colosseum and Ancient Rome. After an Italian traditional lunch enjoy the treasures of Vatican museums, Sistine Chapel and St. Peter&#39;s Basilica.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>What will I visit?</strong></p>

<p>Discover the culture and history of Rome only in 1 day, covering all the most famous highlights of the Eternal City! Our planned itinerary mixes pleasant strolls around the Imperial City of Rome and a visit to the Vatican treasures.</p>

<p>You will start your Roman adventure at the Colosseum, the greatest attraction of the city and first step for most visitors. For this reason, you will see endless lines of people waiting to enter the Colosseum. Skip them with your skip-the-line entrance and go straight inside with your guide and small group. The ancient Roman Colosseum has fascinated visitors throughout centuries, recalling images of brave gladiators, roaring crowds and wild lions growling from their cages. After exploring the Colosseum, take a short walk to the Palatine Hill - the most known of the Roman Seven Hills - to immortalize the views of the ruins below your feet, including Nero’s Circus Maximus, where the famed Roman chariot races were once held.</p>

<p>A main attraction of Ancient Rome is the Roman Forum – the heart of Ancient Rome. A walk around the most suggestive roman ruins of the world is worth your ticket to Italy! Our guides are experts in archaeology and ancient history, so they’re the perfect cicerone to walk you around the Forum. Learn about the House of the Vestal Virgins, the Senate House, the Capitol Palace, the Sacred Way and the Triumph Arches.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As you probably will need a break, enjoy a traditional lunch. You deserve it! Then reach the meeting point of your afternoon tour, in front of Gartour Vatican Office in Viale dei Bastioni di Michelangelo, 21. Your afternoon tour includes, among the others, the Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel. Admire Vatican Rome for the rest of the day!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Dig a little deeper into the beauty of Vatican and visit two must-see attractions, Vatican Museums and St. Peter’s Basilica. As they are listed in every guidebook of Rome and the Vatican, lines to visit them usually stretches for hours. Our Skip the Line Access gets you directly into the heart of the Vatican Museums. With an expert guide leading the way, you will marvel at the sight of the Sistine Chapel, one of the most famous and visited sites in the world and the most emblematic example of papal patronage during the Renaissance period. As you walk, your guide will be ready to give you some tips on what to look out for in Michelangelo’s world known frescoes, from ‘The Last Judgment’ to ‘The Creation of Adam’ on the ceiling. Along the tour, you will see more art jewels such as the Pio Clementino halls with the Laocoon and Apollo Belvedere, the Candelabra and Maps Galleries.<br>The second highlight of the afternoon is St. Peter’s Basilica, where you’ll be blown away by the size and beauty of the world’s biggest ancient cathedral. Step inside and admire the world famous sculpture La Pietà by Michelangelo and the extremely impressive Bernini’s altar, a monumental baldacchino of twisted wood and bronze. Once your tour is finished, your guide will lead you outside to St. Peter’s Square where you will enjoy the ability of Bernini, one of Rome’s best architects and artists.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Why should I take this tour?</strong><br>Thanks to our combined tour Imperial Rome and Vatican Museums you will see the key attractions of Rome in a day. Do not waste time in line or wander aimlessly with the risk of missing important attractions</p></i>
