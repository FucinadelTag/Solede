                        <i><p>Day trips from Rome are a great way to experience central Italy, but it might be quite hard to choose. Should you visit jewel box Naples, with its lovely and picturesque piazzas; or should you visit Pompeii, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world? Great news! You no longer have to choose. Our day trip from Rome covers both of these stunning beauties in just one day.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>What will I visit?</strong><br>Start your trip with a pickup from your centrally located hotel or alternatively, reach the meeting point in town, in front of Gartour’s Vatican Office. Leaving Rome southwards, we will cross the Roman countryside through the pretty landscape of Castelli Romani. On your way to Naples, look out for the Abbey of Montecassino - a spectacular Benedictine monastery that was completely destroyed during the Second World War. Upon arrival in Naples, our local guide will take you for a walking tour of the historical center to admire Piazza del Plebiscito, the impressive square that’s home to Naples Royal Palace, then visit Piazza del Municipio, the Gallery of Umberto I and the San Carlo Opera House.</p>

<p>Your day trip has just begun. Leave Naples and continue your journey to Pompeii. Before visiting the ruins, focus on one of the highlights of our day – lunch! Our tour includes a lunch in a traditional restaurant of the town.</p>

<p>Then head to Pompeii and start your visit to the UNESCO-listed ruins. Learn how this ancient Roman city, along with Herculaneum, was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.C. and lay buried under a thick layer of volcanic ash for centuries. This archeological journey through the ancient city will give you the opportunity to better understand the way Romans used to live at that time. You’ll explore examples of every building in Pompeii – from homes to bathhouses, food stores to outdoor theaters. The city remained hidden for almost 1700 years until the site was discovered during routine excavations. At the end of the visit, you will return to the coach and head back to Rome. Along the way, we will visit a coral and cameo factory where you will have the chance to admire (and purchase, if you’d like) items made with a technique dating back to Greek times! </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Why should I take this tour?</strong><br>Our Naples and Pompeii Tour includes everything you might ask for, from a traditional lunch to the exploration of Pompeii’s ruins, from a walking visit of Naples to a relaxing couch ride in the countryside.</p></i>
