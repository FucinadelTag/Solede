                        <i><p>See the top attractions of Rome on our incredible sightseeing day, combining two of our most loved tours - save money too! Start your day with a pleasant coach and foot tour past top Rome sights, including Piazza Navona, Pantheon, Trevi Fountain and much more. After an Italian traditional lunch enjoy Imperial Rome with a skip-the-line tour of the Colosseum and Ancient Rome.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>What will I visit?</strong></p>

<p>Discover the culture and history of Rome only in 1 day, covering all the most famous highlights of the Eternal City! Our planned itinerary mixes pleasant strolls around the city and itineraries by coach, so you won’t get tired by the end of the day and in the meantime you will have the chance to visit the top attractions of Rome.<br>Crossing the picturesque Piazza della Repubblica with the Fountain of the Nayads, our local guide will take you on a pleasant stroll through the historical centre, where you can admire the Trevi Fountain, a true masterpiece, certainly the most famous and spectacular fountain in Rome. Pass some of the most beautiful monuments and palaces of Rome, including Marco Aurelio Column and Palazzo di Montecitorio. Then reach and visit the Pantheon, whose huge dome is a marvel of engineering even today. Learn from your guide about the history and the architectural secrets of the building that has been standing there for nearly 2 thousands years! <br>After passing the seat of the senate - Palazzo Madama, proceed to Piazza Navona with its picturesque sidewalk cafés and “Fountains of Four Rivers”, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Passing alongside Castel S. Angelo the bus will leave you close to the Vatican City, where you will admire the last stop of our super morning itinerary, St. Peter’s Square. You’ll be blown away by the size and beauty of the world’s biggest ancient cathedral, St. Peter&#39;s Basilica.</p>

<p>As you probably will need a break, enjoy a traditional lunch. You deserve it! Then hop on your bus to admire the Imperial Rome for the rest of the day. Your afternoon tour includes, among the others, the most popular sight in Rome – the Colosseum! </p>

<p>Arriving by coach at Piazza Venezia, continue your tour on foot to the famous Piazza del Campidoglio designed by Michelangelo, from where you will have a fantastic view of the Roman Forum, the most suggestive roman ruins of the world. By coach we will then drive by the Nero’s Circus Maximus - where the famed Roman chariot races were once held, and the Aventino Hill. Stop to admire the Statue of Moses by Michelangelo located in the Church of St. Peter&#39;s in Chains. From here it will take us 5 minutes to reach the star attraction of Rome: The Colosseum. With Skip the Line Access you won’t waste precious time waiting in line and go straight inside with your guide and small group. The ancient Roman Colosseum has fascinated visitors throughout centuries, recalling images of brave gladiators, roaring crowds and wild lions growling from their cages. <br>After this incredible and adventurous day tour around the city, return by bus to the main central points of the city (Via Veneto, Piazza Barberini, Piazza Venezia, Piazza della Repubblica and Termini Rail Station).</p>
