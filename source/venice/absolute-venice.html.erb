                        <i><p>Visit all the most important sights of Venice with a carefully planned itinerary covering everything you may want to visit in the city. Then don’t waste a moment waiting in line with Skip the Line Access at the Doge‘s Palace and St. Mark‘s Basilica with your expert English speaking guide ready to point out key details you could miss on your own.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>What will I visit?</strong></p>

<p>During the first part of the tour you will discover Venice by walking through the narrow alleys, countless bridges and wide piazzas with your guide to point out all details and stories. The first highlight of your Venice walking tour is a city must-see, St. Mark’s Square. With majestic St. Mark’s Basilica, The Doge’s Palace and the Clock Tower, this piazza has long been the design showcase for Venice&#39;s aristocracy. Then head to S. Maria Formosa, with its lively &quot;Campo&quot;, one of the most popular squares in Venice. You’ll see the Church of SS. Giovanni and Paolo from the outside, a venerated jewel that looms over one of the most picturesque squares in Venice. You’ll find yourself right in front of the beautiful Renaissance façade of Scuola Grande di San Marco, one of the most ancient buildings in the city. Walk across few bridges to reach Teatro Malibran, where ancient and recent history meet. No walking visit to Venice would be complete without a stopover at Marco Polo’s old home, where you’ll hear about the famous traveller who departed for Asia and came back with stories of his epic journeys. Head back to St. Mark’s through the famous Mercerie, once the commercial lifeline between Rialto and St. Mark’s Square, and today is Venice’s main shopping district. </p>

<p></p>

<p>No visit to Venice would be complete without a tour of The Doge’s Palace. This impressive palace was once home to the Venetian political power, represented by the Duke. This palace is also home to hundreds of masterpieces, including Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese. We won’t leave the Doge’s palace before seeing the well-known Bridge of Sighs, where prisoners used to take their last glance of Venice before entering into the darkness of the prisons.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The last stop of your visit to Venice will be one of the world’s most magnificent cathedrals, St. Mark’s Basilica. With Skip the Line Access you won’t waste time waiting outside, so take all the time you need to explore this stunning church and learn from your guide about its beautiful gold mosaics and marble inlays, among all of its other treasures. You will also have the chance to admire The Pala D&#39;oro, a perfect example of Byzantine art, with its thousands of gems and precious stones, and enjoy a view of the Treasury, a splendor of the religious art, well preserved along the centuries. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Why should I take this tour?</strong></p>

<p>In just four hours, you will be introduced to the best that Venice has for you, to make your Venetian adventure even more exciting and complete.<br></p></i>
