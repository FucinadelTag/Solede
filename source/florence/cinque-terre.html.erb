                        <i><p>The Cinque Terre takes its name from the five colorful fishing villages of Riomaggiore, Monterosso, Corniglia, Manarola and Vernazza. Do not miss some of the most impressive coastal scenery on Earth. Each town has its distinctive traits, but they all share alleys, vineyards, harbours and amazing scenery.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>What will I visit?</strong></p>

<p>Take the train and relax while you leave Tuscany and approach the Cinque Terre, learn from your guide about Lucca and other passing towns. Admire the brightly colored villages of the Cinque Terre as you get closer and stroll through seaside promenades and quiet piazzas.</p>

<p>Then enjoy a scenic boat ride along the shore while admiring Cinque Terre from the sea, and take a closer look at the rocky coasts with caves, beaches and breathtaking views. </p>

<p>Get off the boat to trek the scenic trails and wander through olive tree groves, vineyards and spectacular coastline.<br></p>

<p>In Cinque Terre you will see that each village comes with its own proud traditions. Monterosso, the largest and oldest of the five, has a lovely span of beach and lush vegetation on the rocks. Riomaggiore, famous for its wine, is an enchanting labyrinth of pastel homes. Manarola has a small harbour, and is where the most recognizable Cinque Terre photos are taken. Vernazza, with its charming square right on the water and its natural harbor — watched over by a crumbling castle and an old church — is the jewel of the Cinque Terre.<br>Once you have arrived in Monterosso you may choose to have a delicious lunch made of fresh seafood from the Mediterranean Sea served in a local restaurant with a perfect view of the sea and surrounding hillside (different menus are also available on request). After lunch you will taste the local ‘Limoncino ligure’ in a quaint wine shop. In the afternoon enjoy some free time for a walk or a swim before heading back to Florence where your full-day tour finishes.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Why should I take this tour?</strong></p>

<p>The Cinque Terre hiking and boat trip will exceed all of your expectations. Explore the beauty of these small villages and experience the best this picturesque scenery can offer you.</p></i>
