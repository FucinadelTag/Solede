                        <i><p>Get a deeper knowledge of the sights and landscapes that make Tuscany a must-visit of any trip <br>to Italy with an expert local guide.</p>

<p> <br><strong>What will I visit?</strong><br></p>

<p>Meet your guide in Florence and then start a scenic countryside drive through Tuscan hills and enchanting cities. The beautiful medieval town of Pisa is your first stop for the day. Go straight into the heart of the city to take a closer look at the unique Leaning Tower, visit the Cathedral and Baptistery in the stunning Piazza dei Miracoli. Enjoy traditional Tuscan recipes made with local products straight from the countryside, and do not miss the generous wine-tasting at the local wineries where Tuscany&#39;s premier wine is still produced.</p>

<p>After lunch the wonders continue with a visit to San Gimignano, universally recognized for its beautiful medieval towers -14 remain out of the 72 initially built in the 13th century! Explore the cobbled streets and small squares of this special town where time seems to have stood still.</p>

<p>Then, following the panoramic roads of the Chianti region, you will get to Siena, famous for its medieval streets and Palio. Here four official guides, speaking English, Spanish, French or Russian (according to your needs) will take you on a tour of Siena to highlight the most beautiful monuments, palazzos and piazzas, including the truly unique Piazza del Campo with its shell shape and brick pavement, and the Piazza del Duomo to have a look at the magnificent gothic Cathedral and its treasures (entry into the Cathedral is also included). Enjoy some free time in Siena before heading back to Florence where your full-day tour finishes.<br></p>

<p><strong>Why should I take this tour?</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p>There is so much to see and do in Tuscany, the only issue is where to start! If you do not have a <br>car or have little time left to explore Tuscany, you will be completely satisfied with this tour</p></i>
